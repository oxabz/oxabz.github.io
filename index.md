## Welcome

Welcome to the v0 of my blog and portfolio. Here you'll find my projects and articles I've written. 

## <i class="fas fa-code"></i> Projects

Through the years I've worked on several projects. I consider that those projects are the best learning experience I had. I had plenty of failed and completed both equally interesting.

### Zeloth : A Text adventure :
- **categories** : video game
- **language** : C++
- **techs** : 
  - json
  - ncurse
- **dates** : 2018 (in progress)

Zeloth was initially conceived as a text based adventure video game. It was a shared project with a colleague. Sadly the colleague that was meant to write the dialogues for the game was unable to work on it due to school.
The project was mainly completed code wise. So I decided on transforming the game in a framework for text adventure. The story writer is entirely done through json but I intend on adding a GUI for helping the story writer.
Zeloth was incidentally my first C++ project and my first object-oriented programming project.

### Micro language compiler and interpreter :
- **categories** : compiler & interpreter
- **language** : C++
- **dates** : 2019

This project is the final project for the DUT's C++ courses. It's objective was to evaluate our conception and C++ skills. 
I created my simple programing language. The created the parser for that language. Then created a runner that runs the program based on the parsed program and a translator that translate the program to C++.

### An untitled dogfight game: 
- **categories** : video game
- **language** : C#, HLSL 
- **game engine** : Unity
- **date** : 2020

This game is a multi-player dogfight game, developed with Unity3D. It was my first serious attempt to a 3D game. This project was a way for me to learn about rendering, GPU computing, and video game networked multiplayer. The main a project I used for the training I needed in Unity3D before my Internship at Dovikino Studio a small video game studio.

### Blog Framework :
- **categories** : Website
- **language** : TypeScript, JSX
- **date** : 2020 (in progress)

This project goal was to replace the static github.io website I'm currently using as a portfolio. The site is composed of a React web app and  a Deno server. It is a semi-static website in which pages are generated from Markdown with added syntax for dynamically displaying the content of a folder with page preview. The Deno server just provides the content and the web app. And the front end react act parses and renders the markdown. This website is made with the intent of making it accessible for people with attention deficit disorder.

### Creating a site accessible to people with ADHD
I lived my whole life with ADHD. It is a handicap that had a huge influence on my whole life. It shaped the way that I act and the way that I worked. So when I wanted to create myself an e-portfolio/blog it had to be taken in consideration. I wanted to create a site both easy for my own use but also for other people with ADHD... [(coming soon)]()

### Compte rendu d'interview (French)
Le lundi 30 novembre, en visioconférence, j’ai pu interviewer un data scientist du CHU de Toulouse, Prosper Burq. Il est le maitre d’alternance qui va me former et superviser mes trois ans à au CHU. Je me suis intéressé à son parcours professionnel et scolaire et à ses observations sur le milieu du privé et du public. Nous avons aussi pu discuter des dangers et des questions moral qui sont soulevé par le machine learning et la datascience... [(more)](compte-rendu.md)
