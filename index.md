## Projects

Through the years I've worked on several projects. I consider that those projects are the best learning experience I had. I had plenty of failed and completed both equally interesting.

### Zeloth : A Text adventure :

- **categorie** : video game
- **language** : C++
- **techs** : 
  - json
  - ncurse
- **dates** : 2018 (in progress)

Zeloth was initialy concieved as a text based adventure video game. It was a shared project with a collegue. saddly the collegue that was writting the dialogues for the game was unable to work on it due to school.
The project was mainly completed code wise. So I decided on transforming the game in a framework for text adventure. The story writter is entirely done through json but I intend on adding a GUI for helping the story writter.
Zeloth was incidentaly my first C++ project and my first object oriented progaming project.

### An untitled dogfight game: 

- **categorie** : video game
- **language** : C#, HLSL 
- **game engine** : Unity
- **date** : 2020

This game is a multi-player dogfight game, developed with Unity3D. It was my first serious attempt to a 3D game. This project was a way for me to learn about rendering, GPU computing, and video game networked multiplayer. The main a project I used for the training I needed in Unity3D before my Internship at Dovikino Studio a small video game studio.

### Blog Framework :

- **categorie** : Website
- **language** : TypeScript, JSX
- **date** : 2020 (in progress)

This project goal was to replace the static github.io website I'm currently using as a portfolio. The site is composed of a React web app and  a Deno server. It is a semi-static website in which pages are generated from Markdown with added syntax for dynamically displaying the content of a folder with page preview. The Deno server just provides the content and the web app. And the front end react act parses and renders the markdown. This website is made with the intent of making it accessible for people with attention deficit disorder.
